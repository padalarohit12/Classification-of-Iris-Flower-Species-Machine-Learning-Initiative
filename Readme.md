# Iris: Machine Learning-Based Flower Classification

In order to categorize iris flowers into three speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”a machine learning model must be constructed. Over 90% accuracy is attained by the model, which employs a Decision Tree algorithm.


## ðŸ“š Tools Used: Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Python, Pandas, and Seaborn

## ðŸ”¥ The Iris dataset was loaded from scikit-learn.
The data was preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.
A decision tree classifier was trained.
Model performance was assessed using the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
Heatmaps were used to visualize the outcomes.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make a clone of the repository.
2. Set up dependencies:
